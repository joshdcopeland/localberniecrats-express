      h2 How to Create Local Chapters:   
      p
        | Firstly, we require that you accept our one main guideline to run a chapter within our network:
      |     
      p
        | We have a singular focus at Local Berniecrats and that is discussing down-ballot Berniecrat candidates with local districts and to discuss their policies and the issues.
        | We really want to avoid chapters turning into presidential campaign support or hate pages for presidential candidates.
        | We understand that everyone will have their opinions in support or criticism about the presidential race but that is a topic for a
        | different group. It is ok to ask your chapter members to join one of those groups for those discussions just as long
        | as there is a clear understanding of the singular focus of Local Berniecrats by your members or anyone who
        | may be visiting. We need to focus only on Berniecrats who are running and encouraging Berniecrats to run!
        | The Local Berniecrats main page will provide supporting documents, image templates, ideas, and encouragement for local
        | chapters and their visitors. We also provide our chapter admins and Main page admins a Facebook group where we can ask questions and support each-other!
      |     
      p 1. On Facebook, hit &quot;Create Group&quot; or page! (Groups are generally recommended)
      |     
      p
        | 2. How to name your local chapter:
        br
        |         &quot;Local Berniecrats&quot; + (your city&apos;s, locality&apos;s, area&apos;s, or State&apos;s name).
        br
        |                   Example:
        br
        | St Louis would name theirs, &quot;
        strong Local Berniecrats St Louis
        | .&quot;
        br
        |         Our friends in the Denver and Boulder CO area are close enough to each other that they named their page,
        |         &quot;Local Berniecrats Denver-Boulder.&quot;
      p THATS IT!
      |     
      p
        | Please message the main page on Facebook with your link when you have it and we will make you a customized cover image.

        strong Pages vs. groups:
        br
        |         You can create a page or group. Pages give you more control over what gets posted while groups are usually
        |         easier to maintain because people can post freely to your group&apos;s wall.
      |     
      p
        strong Fun promotional events:
        br
        |         One idea is to have people promote their local chapter with street corner events holding a big banner with the name of their Page or Group with a Facebook logo. Most Bernie supporters will be quick to take note when they see anything Bernie related near their home. The main hub Local Berniecrats page will be providing templates for banners and other helpful supporting materials.

      |     
      p
        strong Other ways to promote:
        br
        |         Try to connect with any local Bernie groups and let them know about Local Berniecrats and its goal:
        |         Our Goal: Encourage Berniecrats to run for office and help people find their local Berniecrats to support.
        |         Our Quote: &quot;Berniecrats run for local office and Berniecrats support Berniecrats who run!&quot;

        strong What To Do Next:
        br
        |         There will be many ideas to come but here are a few:
        br
        |         
        span
          | - Make available a list of districts in your area and introduce the Berniecrats running for office there.
        br
        |         
        span
          | - Make a pinned post for all your relevant links and please include a link to our main page.
        br
        |         
        span
          | - Keep your chapter regularly updated on events, especially election dates where Berniecrats are running.
        br
        |         
        span
          | - Ask your fellow Local Berniecrats to attend their local civic league, party, Township meetings and be part of the decisions in your area. This will introduce new Berniecrats to the processes that we will ultimately be taking control of!
        br
        |         
        span - Share your ideas with the main hub Local Berniecrats page!
        br
        |         
        span
          | - Encourage your members to run for local office. Find out what issues they find most important to them.
        br
        |         
        span
          | - Encourage your members to start local chapters for more localized areas or communities that they live in, unless yours already is.
        br
        |         
        span
          | - If you find yourself needing to cut and paste links and other verbiage to advertise on other pages, you might want to download a simple clipboard app to store and easily grab reusable text.
        br
        |         
        span
          | Example: We use an Apple Store app called Clipboard++ and I store links and words that we comment on relevant posts.
